# 🎨 My First CSS Project

> *"Every expert was once a beginner."* — This is where it all started!

This is my very first HTML & CSS project from 2020 when I was just starting to learn web development. It's a simple portfolio website that I created as a practice exercise. While it may not be polished or follow best practices, I'm keeping it here as a reminder of how far I've come. We all start somewhere! 😊
